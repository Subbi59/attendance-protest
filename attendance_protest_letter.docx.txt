Subject: Request for Review of Disproportionate Attendance Penalty System

Respected Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express concern regarding the current attendance policy which awards 1% for each attended class while deducting 3% for absences. While attendance is an important measure of student participation, the current system imposes a penalty that is disproportionate, discouraging and misaligned with the principles of fair academic evaluation.

Such asymmetry in the reward and penalty system creates an environment of fear rather than motivation. It also disproportionately affects students with valid reasons for absence—be it health issues, academic competitions, or unavoidable personal circumstances.

As per UGC guidelines, colleges are required to maintain a minimum attendance percentage (typically 75%), but the method of calculating or deducting attendance beyond that should be transparent, consistent, and reasonable. A punitive 3:1 ratio undermines student morale and does not correlate with actual academic performance or engagement.

Therefore, I humbly request the administration to review the policy and implement a fairer structure—such as a 1:1 ratio or an alternative model that incentivizes participation without punitive overreach. Constructive dialogue between students and faculty on this issue could lead to a balanced approach that promotes learning while respecting student well-being.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope the administration will consider this feedback in the spirit of improving academic culture and fairness.

Sincerely,
